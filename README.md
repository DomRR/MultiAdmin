## Installation Instructions:
1. Place MultiAdmin.exe next to your LocalAdmin.exe
2. Create a new folder called servers within the same folder as LocalAdmin/MultiAdmin
3. For each instance with a unique config, create a new directory in the servers directory and place each config.txt in there, so for example for two unique configs:
* servers/FirstServer/config.txt
* servers/SecondServer/config.txt
4. If your config is not in its default location due to a different OS and such, make a new file next to MultiAdmin.exe called scp_multiadmin.cfg and place the follwing setting like so:
- cfg_loc=%appdata%\SCP Secret Laboratory\config.txt

## MultiAdmin Commands
This does not include ServerMod or ingame commands, for a full list type HELP in multiadmin which will produce all commands.

- CONFIG <reload>: Handles reloading the config
- EXIT: Exits the server
- GITHUBGEN [filelocation]: Generates a github .md file outlining all the features/commands
- HELP: Prints out available commands and their function.
- INFO: Prints license and author information.
- NEW <config_id>: Starts a new server with the given config id.
- RESTARTNEXTROUND: Restarts the server at the end of this round
